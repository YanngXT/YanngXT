### Project Experience

<h3>Composition Analysis and Identification Model of Ancient Glass Artifacts</h3>
<p>As a member of the team, I was primarily responsible for data retrieval and analysis, model construction, coding and solving, data visualization, and writing the paper. I used Spearman\'s correlation coefficient and chi-square test to establish a system of macro factors influencing the weathering of glass artifacts and a restoration equation for pre-weathering content. I then used the random forest algorithm to establish a model for classifying types of glass, and further established a sub-classification system using K-means clustering and field difference analysis. I combined the unit and multielement sensitivity analysis method to achieve good stability and explainable fluctuations in the glass classification model. Finally, I used a grey model to predict the potential internal rules of the two subsystems of glass artifacts that were established.'</p>
    
<h3>Deep Learning-Based Model for Live Streaming Video Product Recommendation</h3>
<p>After completing a comprehensive study of the Multimedia Computing course, I worked on the development of a live streaming video product recommendation model under the guidance of Professor Meng at the School of Software from October 2022 to January 2023. The model used fasterRCNN for image feature extraction and various text processing models, including BiLSTM, for text feature extraction. The final recommendation was made using the BPR model, which achieved good results and received high praise from the professor.</p>
